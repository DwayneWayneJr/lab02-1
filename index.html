        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>My name is Ashlyn and I am 31 years old. I was born in Southern
            California and moved to Camano Island Washington just before my
            13<sup>th</sup> birthday. I hated that I was forced to move here
            and planned to move back to California as soon as I turned 18,
            but quickly fell in love with Washington and never left.</p>

                nursing program at Everett CC with a goal of becoming a Certified Nurse
                Midwife, (CNP degree) but quickly realized that playing with catheters
                was not for me. </li>
