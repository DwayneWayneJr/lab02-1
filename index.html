        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>My name is Ashlyn and I am 31 years old.  I was born in Southern 
            California and moved to Camano Island Washington just before my 
            13<sup>th</sup> birthday. I hated that I was forced to move here 
            and planned to move back to California as soon as I turned 18, 
            but quickly fell in love with Washington and never left.</p>
        
        <h2>Education History</h2>
        <p>In 2014 I joined the nursing program at Everett CC with a goal of 
            becoming a Certified Nurse Midwife, (CNP degree) but quickly realized 
            that playing with catheters was not for me. In 2016 a friend of mine 
            told me that I would make a good programmer, so I dabbled with the 
            idea for the last couple of years, and now here I am!</p>

        <h2>Overview of Job Experience</h2>
        <p>Most of my job experience is in the coffee industry.  I started as a 
            barista at 15 and ran a cafe by 16.  In 2016 I was the accounts executive 
            for a large coffee company in the Seattle area.  While in that position I 
            managed 4 cafes, and over 82 resturant and business accounts. I did coffee 
            cuppings (fancy tastings) and got our coffee into Google, Facebook, Limeaide, 
            Homestreet Bank and a few other companies.
        <p>Aside from the coffee industry, I also own a dog training business.  My first
            experience dog training was as a volunteer for a K-9 training facility when I was 
            14.</p>
        <p>I am also a bartender and specialize in craft cocktails.  I work for a company
            called Revolution by the Barrel, bartending for private events and weddings.</p>
        
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal is to become a full stack developer and eventually work in the VR industry 
            creating practical applications for everyday use.</p>
